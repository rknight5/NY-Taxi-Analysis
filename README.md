# NY-Taxi-Analysis

In this project, I explored a dataset containing the taxi trips made in New York City in 2013. From that, I analyzed a subset of this dataset containing 0.5% of all trips (about 850,000 rides) to uncover some websites. 

NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) is the technology provider for the trip data.  More about the project: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml (Links to an external site.)
